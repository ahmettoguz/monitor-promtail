<h2 id="features">🔥 Features</h2>

- **Docker Containerization:** The application is containerized using Docker to ensure consistent deployment, scalability, and isolation across different environments.
- **Docker Compose Deployment:** Simplifies deployment with Docker Compose configuration, enabling easy setup and service orchestration without complex commands.
- **Configuration:** Preconfigured configuration to collect and push Traefik logs to Loki.
- **Persistent Data:** Utilizes a named Docker volume to ensure persistent storage of application data, allowing data to persist across container restarts, rebuilds, and removals.
- **.env Configuration:** All environment variables are easily configurable using the `.env` file, simplifying configuration management.
- **Network Compatibility:** Uses shared Docker network to work with other monitoring tools.
- **Traefik Integration:** Promtail collects logs directly from Traefik, enabling easy monitoring of your reverse proxy activity.
- **Loki Integration:** Logs are pushed to Loki, which store logs and serves to Grafana to create visually appealing dashboards.
